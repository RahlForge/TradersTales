 PERKS
=======
Greenie					You're wet-behind the ears. You've just acquired an entry-level position on a
						commercial merchant vessel, and know next-to-nothing (or maybe absolutely nothing)
						about the life of a "spacer". You're likely to be worked hard, tired faster, and
						your crewmates, especially Professional Spacers, may be inclined to make your life
						harder than is, strictly speaking, necessary.
						• Increased difficulty when taking ratings exams
						• Increased chance to fail scheduled drills
						• Increased chance of negative events when performing ship's tasks
						• Increased chance of negative Social events when working with Professional Spacers 
						  and Indy Brats

Land Rat				You are inexperienced in the ways of the Deep Dark and its space-going vessels. 
						You grew up planetside, and even trips up to the planetary orbital were a unique 
						and rare experience. You are more likely to have trouble fitting in with a crew
						of Professional Spacers or Indy Brats, and may be slower to learn The Articles.
						• Increased difficulty when taking ratings exams
						• Increased chance to fail scheduled drills
						• Increased chance of negative events when performing ship's tasks
						• Increased chance of negative Social events when working with Professional Spacers 
						  and Indy Brats
						• Land Rats are always Greenies, and the effects of that perk stack with this one
				
Indy Brat				You grew up on the cargo deck, bridge or gallery of a family hauler, travelling
						the spacelanes as part of a Trader Family. You have a much easier time learning 
						The Articles, but there's a pretty severe bias when it comes to Professional 
						Spacers, and you may have trouble fitting in on a commercial vessel.
						• Decreased difficulty when taking ratings exams
						• Decreased difficulty when performing ship's tasks
						• Increased chance for negative Social events when working with Professional Spacers 
						  and Land Rats
				
Professional Spacer		You may not have been born into the life, but you have enough experience aboard
						commercial vessels to fit into it. You know The Articles, or at least enough to
						perform your duties to satisfaction. You've earned at least one Half-Share rating,
						and are steadily working upward in your chosen path or path(s). You might make 
						Captain, or even Owner one day. You have a hard time putting up with Greenies,
						Land Rats and Indy Brats.						
						• Increased chance for negative Social events when working with Indy Brats and 
						  Land Rats						
						
Test Machine			You learn FAST, and you remember almost everything you learn. Tests are a cinch.
						You are likely to rocket up the ratings as you take and pass multiple tests each 
						testing period. Your employability is high, and you are far more likely to be
						accepted as a candidate for The Academy.
						• Greatly decreased difficulty when taking ratings exams
						• Increased chance of Academy candidacy
						
Got The Touch			You can read a ship like a book, and handle her like a dream. You can pull amazing,
						unbelievable maneuvers that other wouldn't dare even THINK about trying. You can
						surf the solar waves with the skill of master, all on intuition. When you are at
						the helm, the ship sails more efficiently, reducing cost and transit time, and in-
						creasing crew morale slightly.
						• Ship transit time is reduced when acting as Ship Handler
						• Ship operational cost is slightly reduced when acting as Ship Handler
						• Crew Morale increases slightly as a result of the above two items
						
Charmer					You know how to dress well, speak intelligently, and can charm others easily. You
						make friends very quickly, and are more likely to fit in wherever you go, increasing
						your productivity and crew morale.
						• Increased chance of successfully performing ship's tasks when working with others
						• Decreased chance of negative Social events
						• Increased chance of positive Social events
						
Cargo Genius			Your knowledge of trade goods and market prices is second-to-none. Everywhere you
						go, good deals appear to you. You are a good companion to shop with, or help run a
						co-op. Ship's morale increases with you around as the shares go up. Crew are, 
						however, more likely to get in a bit too much trouble with all the extra cred to
						spend when docked. 
						• Decreased operational cost when assigned to Steward division
						• Increased ship profit when assigned to Cargo division
						• Crew shares and morale increase if assigned to a co-op when in-port and off-duty 
						
Cooking, It's My Life	Your passion is making the finest meals, and seeing the pleasure others derive from
						them. When you're in the galley, crew morale skyrockets from the excellent meals you
						provide, and with a good Cargo Genius at hand, you can help reduce the expense of
						your section to increase profits and further increase morale.
						• Greatly increased morale when assigned to Steward division
						• Slightly decreased operational cost if working with a Cargo Genius in Steward 
						  division

Sludge Monkey			You're just good with sludge. Actually, most things slimy, slightly smelly or bubbly
						tend to speak to you a bit more clearly than most people generally understand. You
						find "Foggy Bottom" to be a happy home, and an enjoyable workplace. Environmental
						systems are much easier for you to fix and operate.
						• Increased chance to successfully perform ship's tasks when assigned to Environmental
						• Decreased chance of negative Environmental events when assigned to Environmental

Gadget Head

Combat Expert

Booze Hound

Gear Head

Lone Wolf Syndrome		You have a tendency to take on more than you can actually handle on your own. This
						tends to get you into more trouble than normal. 
						• Greatly increased risk of negative events occurring
